# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Bad results in regional contests.| Results from all grades throughout time |Relational, structured database |Insights: When the school started to perform bad compared to other schools, which grade has the worst results. Decisions: What processes other schools started to apply in the year where we satrted to lag behind. Which grade is the weakest link, why.
| Vaccination | Several people don't turn up to their vaccination appointment |Real-time data of vaccine doses unused compared to original plan |in structured database | Insights: Details about people who don't come: Usual age, gender, etc..Decision: Target specifically these groups to educate them about the importance of taking the vaccine if they are regsitered. Send SMS to people living nearby to take the leftover vaccines|
| Productivity |Opening facebook too often in working hours |log of opening facebook.com (when during the day, coming from which program, how long time spent there) |In a simple database, in structured format |Insights: When during the day I 'm most often deconcentrized, how much time I spend on facebook. Decisions: Set a reminder for the most frequent part of the day when I'm  opening facebook to do something more productive instead. (for example: reading industry news) |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
